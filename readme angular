Data binding to views through view to model of one and two wauy data binding
NGfor ul li 	component template html
Event handling
 NgModule.declarations?: (any[] | Type<any>)[] | undefined
The set of components, directives, and pipes (declarables) that belong to this module.

@usageNotes
The set of selectors that are available to a template include those declared here, and those that are exported from imported NgModules.

Declarables must belong to exactly one module. The compiler emits an error if you try to declare the same class in more than one module. Be careful not to declare a class that is imported from another module.

Example
The following example allows the CommonModule to use the NgFor directive.


*@NgModule*  
({
declarations: [NgFor]
})
class CommonModule {
}
Generate modules: Letâ€™s use the CLI to generate additional
modules:
ng generate module shared
ng generate module routing --routing
ng generate module sales
ng generate module supportng generate component sales
ng new directives-ex300

ng generate component support
ng generate component shared
Introducing Directives
Directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute) that tell Angular to
attach a specified behavior to an existing element.
ngIf
ngFor
ngSwitch
ngClass
ngStyle
